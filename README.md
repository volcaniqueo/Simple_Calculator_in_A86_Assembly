# Simple_Calculator_in_A86_Assembly
This project was my 2nd Homework for the course CMPE 230 (Systems Programming) at Bogazici University.
## About the Project
This was my first project on any of the Assembly languages. We (me and my group partner) have implemented a simple calculation mechanism that evaluates the given expression in postfix notation. Detailed requirements can be found in the description file. There is also a documentation file that describes the code and our approach.

Note: Since it was our first project on such a low level language, our design was straightforward. But when I see the code now, (While taking CMPE344 Computer Architecture course that focuses on low level design and much more) I found it to be very inefficient.

## To Run the Code
We executed our code on a virtual machine that has the Windows XP. But as an easier approach, one can search the web and try one of the many online compilers to run 'main.asm'.
